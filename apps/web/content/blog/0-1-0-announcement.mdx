We're thrilled to announce the **upcoming release of Hydra AI v0.1.0!** This release brings significant improvements to our React interface and introduces powerful new features that make AI integration smoother and more powerful than ever.

## What's New in 0.1.0

### Enhanced React Interface

We've completely revamped the developer experience with several key improvements:

- **Message Threading**: New hooks and persistence capabilities for better conversation management
- **Streamlined Streaming**: Easy-to-setup streaming with powerful hooks for fine-grained control
- **Improved Decision Loop**: Upgraded system for identifying the right function calls (tools) and components to show end users
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Keep users informed about what the AI is doing in real-time
- **Stateful Components**: Component interactions are now treated as input for future generations, creating more contextual and relevant responses

and more!

### New Dashboard

We're introducing a comprehensive dashboard that provides:

- Insights into user interactions
- Detailed analytics
- Project-level configuration tools

This new dashboard will help you better understand how users interact with your AI features and make it easier to configure and optimize your adaptive UI experiences.

## Launch Event

We're excited to officially release version 0.1.0 at the [Seattle Startup Summit 2025](https://lu.ma/seattle-startup-summit) on March 28th. Join us to see these features in action and learn how they can enhance your applications.
