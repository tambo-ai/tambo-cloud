import GitHubLink from "@/components/github-button";

Now that we've registered the components with Hydra, we can test the app!

## Test the app

    Try sending some messages like:

    - "Add a task to my list"
    - "What tasks do I have?"
    - "What tasks do I have that are not complete?"

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/assets/slack-ai-todo-demo.gif"
    alt="Demo of Hydra AI Slack App"
    width="600"
    className="rounded-lg border dark:border-zinc-800"
  />
</p>

## Congratulations!

Now you've got a Slack AI app that responds to user messages with interactive UI components!

To make an app for a different purpose, all you have to do is change the components you register with Hydra.
