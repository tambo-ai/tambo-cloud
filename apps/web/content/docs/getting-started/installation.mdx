---

import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";

## Installation

The `hydra init` command helps you set up Hydra AI in your Next.js project. Here's how to get started:

### Prerequisites

- A Node.js project with a valid `package.json`
- Command must be run from your project root

### Basic Usage

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>

```bash tab="npm"
npx hydra-ai-cli init [--srcdir <directory>]
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn dlx hydra-ai-cli init [--srcdir <directory>]
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx hydra-ai-cli init [--srcdir <directory>]
```

</Tabs>

### Options

- `--srcdir`: Source directory to scan for components (defaults to `src`)

### What Happens During Installation

### Documentation for Hydra AI CLI Initialization Process

This guide will walk you through the `init` command of the Hydra AI CLI tool, explaining each step and showing what the process would look like in a terminal.

---

### Step 1: Validate Root Directory

**Description**: The command checks if a valid `package.json` file exists in the root directory.

**Terminal Output**:

```bash title="Terminal Output - Root Directory Validation"
Initializing Hydra AI. This will create a `hydra-config.ts` file in your project, with initial component registrations.

This doesn't look like a valid Node.js project. Please run this command from the root of your project, where the `package.json` file is located.
```

If validation is successful:

```bash title="Terminal Output - Validation Success"
Initializing Hydra AI. This will create a `hydra-config.ts` file in your project, with initial component registrations.
```

---

### Step 2: Authenticate User

**Description**: Ensures the user is authenticated before continuing. If not already logged in, prompts for authentication.

**Terminal Output**:

```bash title="Terminal Output - Authenticate User"
Fetching authentication details...
Authenticated successfully.
```

---

### Step 3: Select or Create Project

**Description**: Fetches existing projects or prompts the user to create a new one.

**Terminal Output** (when projects exist):

```bash title="Terminal Output - Select or Create Project"
Fetching projects... ✔ Projects retrieved
? Select a project:
  > Project 1
    Project 2
```

**Terminal Output** (when no projects exist):

```bash title="Terminal Output - No Projects Found"
Fetching projects... ✔ Projects retrieved
No projects found. Let's create one.
? Enter project name: My New Project
Creating project... ✔ Project "My New Project" created
```

---

### Step 4: Generate and Save API Key

**Description**: Generates a new API key and saves it in a `.env` file.

**Terminal Output**:

```bash title="Terminal Output - Generate and Save API Key"
Generating API key... ✔ API key generated
? Which .env file would you like to save the API key to? (default: .env.local)
> .env.local

API key saved to .env.local file
```

---

### Step 5: Install Hydra AI Package

**Description**: Checks if the `hydra-ai` package is installed and prompts the user to install it if not.

**Terminal Output**:

```bash title="Terminal Output - Install Hydra AI Package"
? Do you want to install the `hydra-ai` package? (Y/n)
Installing hydra-ai package...
```

After successful installation:

```bash title="Terminal Output - Install Hydra AI Package"
+ hydra-ai@x.y.z
added 1 package in 2s
```

---

### Step 6: Scan for Components

**Description**: Scans the `src` directory for components to register.

**Terminal Output**:

```bash title="Terminal Output - Scan for Components"
Scanning for components...
✔ Components found: 5
```

---

### Step 7: Extract and Register Components

**Description**: Extracts component details and registers them in a `hydra-config.ts` file.

**Terminal Output**:

```bash title="Terminal Output - Extract and Register Components"
Extracting components... ✔ Component extraction complete
Creating hydra-config.ts file...
✔ `hydra-config.ts` file created successfully!
```

---

### Sample `hydra-config.ts` Output

```typescript title="src/hydra-config.ts"
/* This file was generated by the Hydra AI CLI. Edit each component registration as needed. */
import MyComponent from "./components/MyComponent";
import { HydraClient } from "hydra-ai";

export function registerComponents() {
  const hydra = new HydraClient({
    hydraApiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HYDRAAI_API_KEY,
  });

  hydra.registerComponent(
    "MyComponent",
    "Description of MyComponent",
    MyComponent,
    { prop1: "string", prop2: "number" },
  );

  return hydra;
}
```

---

### Final Output

Once the process completes, you should see:

```bash title="Terminal Output - Final Output"
Hydra AI initialization complete. Your components are now registered!
