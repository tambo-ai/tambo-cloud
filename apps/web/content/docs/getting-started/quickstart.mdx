If you don't need any extra information and just want to get a tambo app started, from the root of a NextJS app run:

```bash
npx tambo full-send
```

This command will:

- Setup a tambo project and get you an API key
- Install MessageThread components that are hooked up to tambo
- Show you how to wrap your app with the `<TamboProvider>`

Once it completes, you can update your `src/app/layout.tsx` file to enable tambo:

```tsx
<TamboProvider apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY!}>
  {children}
</TamboProvider>
```

Now you can run your Tambo app locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Adding MessageThreadFull to your app

The `<MessageThreadFull>` component that the `full-send` command installed provides a complete chat interface for your AI assistant. Here's how to add it to your `src/app/page.tsx` file:

```tsx title="src/app/page.tsx"
import { MessageThread } from "../source/components/MessageThread";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <MessageThread />
    </main>
  );
}
```
