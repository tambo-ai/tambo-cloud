## Handle streaming status of each prop

Tambo provides a `useTamboStreamStatus` hook that allows you to track the streaming status of each prop individually.

For example, if I want my component to render most props as they stream in, but I want the `createdAt` prop to render only when it is done streaming in:

```tsx title="props streaming status"
export default function Note({
  title = "",
  content = "",
  createdAt = "",
}: NoteProps) {
  const { propStatus } = useTamboStreamStatus();

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <p>{content}</p>
      {propStatus["createdAt"]?.isSuccess && <p>{createdAt}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Each prop in `propStatus` has the following fields:

- `isPending`: whether we have received no values for this prop yet.
- `isStreaming`: whether the we have started receiving values for this prop.
- `isSuccess`: whether this prop has completed streaming without any errors.
- `error?`: any error message recieved during streaming of this prop.
