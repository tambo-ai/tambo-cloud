title: Response Component Streaming
description: Stream response components from Tambo as they are being generated.
---

Similar to response text, when you send a message to Tambo, Tambo will stream props into any chosen component's props as they are generated rather than waiting for the entire response to complete. The current state of a component being streamed in can be accessed through the latest thread message`s `renderedComponent` field.

To see the response component update in realtime, render your thread messages like normal.

```tsx title="streaming.tsx"
import { useTambo } from "@tambo-ai/react";

const { thread } = useTambo();

...

<div>
  {thread.messages.map((message, index) => (
    <div
      key={index}
    >
      <div>{message.renderedComponent}</div>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>;
```

## Preparing Components for Streaming

Since Tambo will render the response components before the props object is completely returned, your components must be prepared to receive `undefined` values while streaming is in progress to avoid rendering errors.

One way to handle this is to set default values to show until the values are generated:

```tsx title="streaming.tsx"
const MyComponent = ({ name = "Loading..." }: { name?: string }) => {
  return <div>{name}</div>;
};
```

For props where defaults don't make sense, you can allow them to be optional and render a loading state within the component:

```tsx title="streaming.tsx"
const MyComponent = ({ age }: { age?: number }) => {
  return <div>{age ?? "Loading..."}</div>;
};
```

In the previous examples, as soon as a single character is generated by Tambo, the default will be ignored and the user will see the field updating. For more detailed control over each prop's completion status during streaming, see:
