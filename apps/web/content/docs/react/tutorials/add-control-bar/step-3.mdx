title: "Step 3: Register components with Hydra"
---

In this step, we'll register the CRM components with Hydra so that Hydra can respond with interactive UI components through the control bar.

## Register Components

Let's start by "telling" Hydra about the components we want it to be able to control and show in responses.

We already have the components we need in from our app under `/src/components/searchable-components`.

There are also some loading components under `/src/components/skeletons.tsx` that we'll show while the "main" components are loading.

To register them with Hydra, we'll update the `hydra-config.ts` file we created earlier to make a `registerComponent` call for each of them.

    1. **Update `hydra-config.ts`**

        Let's update the `hydra-config.ts` file to register these components. Replace the contents of the file with the following:

        ```ts
        import { HydraClient } from "hydra-ai";
        import { ComponentContextTool } from "hydra-ai/dist/hydra-ai/model/component-metadata";
        import AddLeadForm from "./components/searchable-components/add-lead-form";
        import AddMeetingForm from "./components/searchable-components/add-meeting-form";
        import AddMessageForm from "./components/searchable-components/add-message-form";
        import EditLeadForm from "./components/searchable-components/edit-lead-form";
        import EditMeetingForm from "./components/searchable-components/edit-meeting-form";
        import LeadDetails from "./components/searchable-components/lead-details";
        import { LeadListSkeleton } from "./components/searchable-components/lead-list";
        import LeadListContainer from "./components/searchable-components/lead-list-container";
        import LeadNotes from "./components/searchable-components/lead-notes";
        import MeetingDetails from "./components/searchable-components/meeting-details";
        import { MeetingsListSkeleton } from "./components/searchable-components/meetings-list";
        import MeetingsListContainer from "./components/searchable-components/meetings-list-container";
        import MessageDetails from "./components/searchable-components/message-details";
        import { MessagesListSkeleton } from "./components/searchable-components/messages-list";
        import MessagesListContainer from "./components/searchable-components/messages-list-container";
        import { AddMessageFormSkeleton, EditMeetingFormSkeleton, FormSkeleton, LeadDetailsSkeleton, LeadNotesSkeleton, MeetingDetailsSkeleton, MeetingFormSkeleton, MessageDetailsSkeleton } from "./components/skeletons";
        import { LeadFiltersSchema, LeadSchema, MeetingFiltersSchema, MeetingSchema, MessageFiltersSchema, MessageSchema } from "./schemas/lead";
        import { getLeads } from "./services/leads-service";
        import { getMessages } from "./services/messages-service";

        const hydra = new HydraClient({
            hydraApiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HYDRA_API_KEY,
            hydraApiUrl: "https://api.usehydra.ai",
        });

        const getLeadsTool: ComponentContextTool = {
            getComponentContext: getLeads,
            definition: {
                name: "getLeads",
                description: "Get a list of all the leads, which includes meetings, notes, and messages",
                parameters: []
            }
        }

        const getMessagesTool: ComponentContextTool = {
            getComponentContext: getMessages,
            definition: {
                name: "getMessages",
                description: "Get a list of all the messages",
                parameters: []
            }
        }

        export const initializeHydra = () => {
            if (!LeadSchema || !LeadSchema.shape) {
                console.error("LeadSchema is not properly defined");
                return;
            }

            const leadSchemaString = JSON.stringify(LeadSchema.shape);
            const meetingSchemaString = JSON.stringify(MeetingSchema.shape);
            const messageSchemaString = JSON.stringify(MessageSchema.shape);
            const leadFiltersSchemaString = JSON.stringify(LeadFiltersSchema.shape);
            const meetingFiltersSchemaString = JSON.stringify(MeetingFiltersSchema.shape);
            const messageFiltersSchemaString = JSON.stringify(MessageFiltersSchema.shape);

            hydra.registerComponent({
                name: "add-lead-form",

                component: AddLeadForm,

                loadingComponent: MessagesListSkeleton
            });
        };

        export default hydra;

        ```


    **Some things to note:**

    In each `registerComponent` call, we need to tell Hydra about the component's name, description, input data (or 'props') schema, and the reference to the actual component.

    In addition, we also are using optional fields:
    - `loadingComponent`: A component to show while the main component is loading.
    - `contextTools`: A list of functions that Hydra can call to get extra context data when the component is chosen. In this case, we're using the `getLeadsTool` and `getMessagesTool` to let Hydra see the leads and messages data when deciding how to generate the input data for the components.

Now we've got Hydra configured, let's test it out!
