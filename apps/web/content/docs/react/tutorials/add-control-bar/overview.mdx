## Add a Control Bar to your React App

This tutorial will guide you through adding a "control bar" to a demo CRM React app using Hydra. This control bar allows users to interact with your app just by saying what they want to do instead of learning how to navigate the UI to do complicated tasks.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/assets/control-bar/demo.gif"
    alt="Demo of Hydra AI Slack App"
    width={700}
    className="rounded-lg border dark:border-zinc-800"
  />
</p>

## What you'll learn

At the end of this tutorial, you'll have a control bar in a React app that allows users to interact with your app using natural language.

You'll learn:

- How to use Hydra to add an ai-powered control bar to your React app.
- How Hydra AI simplifies the process of building AI apps.
- How you can customize the UI components that Hydra can control, and how it controls them.
