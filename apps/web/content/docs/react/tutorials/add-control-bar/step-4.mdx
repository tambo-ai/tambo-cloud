import GitHubLink from "@/components/github-button";

Now that we've registered the components with Hydra, we can hook up the control bar to hydra and test the app!

## Add the control bar to the home page

Let's add the control bar to the home page, and pass our Hydra instance to it.

We can replace `src/app/page.tsx` with the following:

```tsx
"use client";
import CRMDashboard from "@/components/dashboard/crm-dashboard";
import ControlBar from "@/components/ui/control-bar";
import hydra, { initializeHydra } from "@/hydra-config";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export default function Home() {
  useEffect(() => {
    initializeHydra();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen p-8 pb-20 font-[family-name:var(--font-geist-sans)] bg-[#2E3645]">
      <main className="flex flex-col gap-8 items-center justify-center pt-24">
        <ControlBar hydra={hydra} />
        <CRMDashboard />
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Try it out!

    If you don't still have the app running, you can start it up again with

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Try some commands like:

    - "show my leads who work at MegaCorp"
    - "add a meeting with John for next week"

    className="rounded-lg border dark:border-zinc-800"
  />
</p>

## Congratulations!

Now you've got an AI React app that responds to user messages with interactive UI components!

To make an app for a different purpose, all you have to do is change the components you register with Hydra.
