The Tambo CLI is a tool to help you get Tambo apps setup quickly.
Here you'll find a description of each command available in the tambo cli.

### add

`npx tambo add <componentname>`

Adds a component hooked up to Tambo to your app.
This command will install the component file directly into the `/components/ui` directory of your app so you can easily customize the behavior and styles. It will also install the components' dependencies and update your styles.

### init

`npx tambo init`

Walks you through creating a Tambo project and getting your free API Key. If you don't already have an account, <a href="/dashboard" className="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">sign up for free</a> to get your API key.

After obtaining your API key, you'll need to set it up in your project:

<Callout type="info" title="API Key Setup">
  Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project to store your Tambo API
  key: ``` NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here ``` Replace
  `your_api_key_here` with the actual API key you received during setup. This
  file should not be committed to version control as it contains sensitive
  information.
</Callout>

### full-send

`npx tambo full-send`

For instant AI project setup, performs the same project setup steps as `init`, and also installs a few useful components.
