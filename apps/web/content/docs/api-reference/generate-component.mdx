title: generateComponent
---

This function is used to generate a component based on the user's input. It will return a promise that resolves to a `GenerateComponentResponse` object (described below), which may include a component and a message to display to the user.

```tsx
const response = await hydraClient.generateComponent(
  "I want to see all my meetings for today",
  handleProgressUpdate,
);

//display the response.component and response.message somewhere in the UI
```

### Parameters

`input`: `string` **required**

       The user's input. This is the natural language string that Hydra will use to understand the user's intent and decide which of the registered components (if any) to generate.

`handleProgressUpdate`: `(progress: GenerateComponentResponse) => void` **optional**

       An optional callback function that Hydra will call at each major step of the component generation. This is useful for displaying loading messages during intermediate steps.

       The GenerateComponentResponse object has a `stage` enum property that can be used to determine the current stage of the component generation, described below.

### GenerateComponentResponse object

The `GenerateComponentResponse` object is returned by the `generateComponent` function.

```tsx
export interface GenerateComponentResponse {
  component?: ReactElement | null;
  message: string;
  stage: GenerationStage;
  loading: boolean;
  suggestedActions?: SuggestedAction[];
}
```

#### Fields

`component`: `ReactElement | null`

       The component to display to the user, or null if the component is still being generated or if Hydra has decided that no registered component is appropriate for the user's input.

`message`: `string`

       A message to display to the user, or the "AI response" to the user's input, which into account the chosen component.

`stage`: `GenerationStage`

       The current stage of the component generation.
       The possible values for `stage` are:

        - `CHOOSING_COMPONENT`: Hydra is choosing which component to generate based on the user's input.
        - `FETCHING_CONTEXT`: Hydra is fetching additional context for the chosen component using one of the component's context tools.
        - `HYDRATING_COMPONENT`: Hydra is generating the props for the chosen component.
        - `COMPLETE`: Hydra has finished generating the component and the response contains the component and a message to display to the user.

`loading`: `boolean`

       A boolean value that indicates whether the component is still being generated or not.

`suggestedActions`: `SuggestedAction[]`

       A list of suggested "next steps" to display to the user, generated by Hydra based on what the user's intent seems to be.

       Each suggested action is an object with a `label` and `actionText` property.

       The `label` is the short text to display to the user describing the action, and the `actionText` is the full message to send to Hydra on behalf of the user when they select the action.
