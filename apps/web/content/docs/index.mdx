Tambo is a **React package** for building AI-powered applications with generative UI, where users interact through natural language.

Use Tambo to build AI chats, copilots, or completely custom AI interactions.

## Core Elements

### React package `@tambo-ai/react`

The react package provides hooks that help you build the list of components and tools Tambo can use, send user messages to the Tambo API, and interact with responses and message threads.

Wrap your app with the `<TamboProvider/>` and use the hooks within your components to send messages and show responses.

```tsx
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";

export function Home() {
  return (
    <TamboProvider
      components={myTamboComponents}
      tools={myTamboTools}
      apiKey={tamboApiKey}
    >
      <MyAiApp />
    </TamboProvider>
  );
}
```

### Tambo API

The API processes user messages, interacts with LLMs to generate AI responses, manages conversation threads, orchestrates tool calls, and handles user authentication.

import { MessageCircleMore } from "lucide-react";

### UI Component Library

The component library provides pre-built React components with Tambo integrated for common AI application interfaces like chat, AI-powered forms, and visualizations. Use these to speed up your AI application building.

import { Box } from "lucide-react";
