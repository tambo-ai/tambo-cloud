description: Learn how to make your UI components available to Tambo AI.
---

Tambo allows you to register your React components as UI tools that the AI can intelligently choose and populate with data. Instead of generating components from scratch, you tell Tambo which components are available and what props they expect using a `registerComponent` call. This enables conversational control of your app where users can ask for specific functionality and Tambo responds with the appropriate component filled with relevant data.
