One of the core features of Tambo is its ability to intelligently respond to user messages with UI components filled with relevant data instead of just text. With this ability, Tambo allows your users to conversationally control your app with AI assistance rather than simply have questions answered.

Tambo does not, however, generate components from scratch on-the-fly. Instead, you "tell" Tambo which components are available and what props they expect using a `registerComponent` call.

The `@tambo-ai/react` package provides hooks to help with this.

## Component Registration

You can pass a list of components directly to the `TamboProvider` component. All of the components will be visible to the various Tambo hooks and components that are rendered inside `<TamboProvider>`.

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
const components: TamboComponent[] = [
  {
    name: "WeatherDisplay",
    description: "A display of the weather in a city",
    component: WeatherDisplay,
    propsDefinition: {
      data: "{ date: string; day: { maxtemp_c: number; mintemp_c: number; avgtemp_c: number; maxwind_kph: number; totalprecip_mm: number; avghumidity: number; condition: { text: string; icon: string } } }",
    }, // The shape of the props this component expects
    associatedTools: [tools.forecast, tools.history], // Any context tools that Tambo should focus on when getting extra information to fill in the props of this component
  },
];

<TamboProvider components={components}>
  <App />
</TamboProvider>;
```

When creating the list of components, you may not yet have access to the tools callbacks that you need, because they may need additional context or authentication.

You can still register the component without the tools using this approach, and then register the tools later with `addToolAssociation`. See the [Tools](/docs/concepts/tools) documentation for more information.

## Dynamic Component Registration

An alternative approach to the above is to register the components dynamically. This is useful if you need to register components at runtime, or if you need to register components with tools that are not yet available.

Note that when you register a component dynamically, it makes these tools available to all components within the the `<TamboProvider>` component.
Here's an example that uses the `registerComponent` function from the `useTamboRegistry()` hook to tell Tambo about a WeatherDisplay component:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
const { registerComponent } = useTamboRegistry();

useEffect(() => {
  registerComponent({
    name: "WeatherDisplay", // The name of the component
    description: "A display of the weather in a city", // A description of what the component is for and when it should be used by Tambo.
    component: WeatherDisplay, // The actual component
    propsDefinition: {
      data: "{ date: string; day: { maxtemp_c: number; mintemp_c: number; avgtemp_c: number; maxwind_kph: number; totalprecip_mm: number; avghumidity: number; condition: { text: string; icon: string } } }",
    }, // The shape of the props this component expects
    associatedTools: [tools.forecast, tools.history], // Any context tools that Tambo should focus on when getting extra information to fill in the props of this component
  });
}, [registerComponent]);
```

Now when a user sends a message asking about the weather in a city, Tambo can respond with this WeatherDisplay component!
