Tools enable Tambo to interact with your application's data and functionality by providing a type-safe way to extend the AI's capabilities with custom business logic. When applicable, Tambo automatically calls these tools and uses their outputs to help decide how to respond to messages, what component to show, and what data to fill the component with. Tools are asynchronous functions that can perform any logic you want, from fetching weather data to processing user requests through your existing APIs.
