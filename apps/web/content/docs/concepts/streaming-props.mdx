title: Streaming Props
description: Efficiently handle streaming component props with automatic state updates.

When working with AI-generated content in Tambo, you often need to update your component state when new content streams in. The `useTamboStreamingProps` hook simplifies this common pattern by automatically detecting and applying changes as props arrive incrementally, eliminating repetitive useEffect code and ensuring your component only re-renders when values actually change. This is especially useful when combining streaming with component state management to create smooth, responsive user experiences.
