description: Pass component state to Tambo for better context and continuity.

Tambo can track the internal state of generated components with `useTamboComponentState` and use it as context for responding to subsequent user messages. This allows Tambo to understand actions your user has taken within a component. By replacing `useState` with `useTamboComponentState`, your component's internal state becomes part of the conversation context.
