title: Component State
description: Pass component state to tambo so it can use the state as context for following user messages.

Tambo can track the internal state of generated components using `useTamboComponentState`, providing valuable context for responding to subsequent user messages.

## Benefits

- Tambo uses component state as context for responding to user messages
- State persists when historical messages are recalled

## How It Works

Components registered with tambo often have internal state values that update what's rendered as users interact. For example, an "email sending" component might include:

```tsx title="Simple email component"

export const EmailSender = () => {
  ...
  const [emailBody, setEmailBody] = useState("") // tracks the message being typed
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false) // tracks whether the 'send' button has been clicked
  ...
}
```

For tambo to understand these state values when users say things like "finish this email for me" or "did I send that email earlier?", simply replace `useState` with `useTamboComponentState`:

```tsx title="Email component with tambo state"

export const EmailSender = () => {
  ...
  const [emailBody, setEmailBody] = useTamboComponentState("");
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useTamboComponentState(false);
  ...
}
```

Keep in mind that the component state will only be updated when the component is re-rendered, so if you are streaming props into the component, you will need to manually update the state when the props change.

Good news for you is that we have a solution for that in the next section.
