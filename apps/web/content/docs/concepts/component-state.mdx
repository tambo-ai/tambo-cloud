description: Pass component state to Tambo for better context and continuity.

Tambo can track the internal state of generated components with `useTamboComponentState` and use it as context for responding to subsequent user messages. This allows Tambo to understand actions your user has taken within a component. By replacing `useState` with `useTamboComponentState`, your component's internal state becomes part of the conversation context.

```tsx
const DarkmodeToggle = () => {
  // Instead of useState, use useTamboComponentState
  const [darkModeEnabled, setDarkModeEnabled] = useTamboComponentState(
    "darkModeEnabled",
    false
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Dark mode is {darkModeEnabled ? "enabled" : "disabled"}</h3>
      <button onClick={() => setDarkModeEnabled(!darkModeEnabled)}>
        {darkModeEnabled ? "Disable" : "Enable"} Dark Mode
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

// Tambo will know the current value of `darkModeEnabled` when generating responses
```
