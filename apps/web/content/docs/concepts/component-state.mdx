title: Component State
description: Pass component state to Tambo for better context and continuity.

Tambo can track the internal state of generated components using `useTamboComponentState`, providing valuable context for responding to subsequent user messages. This allows the AI to understand what's happening within your components when users make requests like "finish this email for me" or "did I send that email earlier?" By replacing `useState` with `useTamboComponentState`, your component's internal state becomes part of the conversation context, enabling more intelligent and contextual AI responses.
