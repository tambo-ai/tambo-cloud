Tools are normal JavaScript functions that you give Tambo access to. When processing a user message, Tambo may decide to use tools you have registered to retrieve information or to take actions. Tools allow you to extend the capabilities of Tambo.

```tsx
const getWeather = (city: string) => {
  return `The weather in ${city} is warm and sunny!`;
};

export const tools: TamboTool[] = [
  {
    name: "getWeather",
    description: "A tool to get the current weather conditions of a city",
    tool: getWeather,
    toolSchema: z
      .function()
      .args(z.string().describe("The city name to get weather information for"))
      .returns(z.string()),
  },
];

<TamboProvider tools={tools}>
  <App />
</TamboProvider>;
```
