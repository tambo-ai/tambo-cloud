Streaming allows you to show response messages and components from Tambo in real-time as they are being generated, creating more responsive and engaging user experiences. Instead of waiting for the entire response to complete, Tambo handles updating the thread's final message as data streams in, allowing users to see content appear progressively. This is especially useful for longer responses or when components need to be populated with data that arrives incrementally.
