Tambo automatically analyzes user interactions and generates contextual suggestions after each assistant message, helping users understand what they can do next. These suggestions appear as clickable options that users can accept to continue the conversation, making the interface more intuitive and reducing the cognitive load of figuring out what to ask next. The `useTamboSuggestions` hook provides easy access to these suggestions with built-in loading states and error handling.

```tsx
const { suggestions, isLoading, error } = useTamboSuggestions();

// Display suggestions as clickable buttons
{
  suggestions.length > 0 && (
    <div className="suggestions-container">
      <h4>Suggested next steps:</h4>
      {suggestions.map((suggestion, index) => (
        <button
          key={index}
          onClick={() => handleSuggestionClick(suggestion)}
          className="suggestion-button"
        >
          {suggestion}
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

// Show loading state while suggestions are being generated
{
  isLoading && (
    <div className="suggestions-loading">
      <span>Generating suggestions...</span>
    </div>
  );
}
```
