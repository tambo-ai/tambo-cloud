To ensure each of user in your application can see only their own threads and messages, Tambo allows you to bring your own authentication. Generate an auth token and pass it to Tambo, and configure how Tambo should verify the token to get a user ID. Preset configurations for many popular authentication providers are available to choose from.

```tsx
const userToken = useUserToken(); // Get token from your auth provider
...

<TamboProvider userToken={userToken}>
    <App/>
</TamboProvider>;
```
