Message threads are the core building block for creating interactive AI experiences with Tambo. They provide a structured way to manage conversations between users and AI, with hooks that make it easy to interact with thread state, send messages, and display responses. Each thread maintains a history of messages and can include both text content and rendered components, allowing for rich conversational interfaces where users can see both chat history and dynamic UI components.
