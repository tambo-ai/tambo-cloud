title: Message Threads
---

Message threads are the core building block for creating interactive AI experiences with Tambo. They provide a structured way to manage conversations between users and AI.

Tambo provides hooks to easily interact with the current thread state and its messages, generation stage, and other values.

```tsx
const { thread } = useTamboThread();
```

This thread state value is updated automatically by tambo as user messages are sent, and as response messages from tambo are received.

### Sending thread messages

To send a user's message to tambo, you can use the `sendThreadMessage` hook:

```tsx
const { sendThreadMessage } = useTamboThread();

await sendThreadMessage("What is the weather like today?");
```

Tambo will update the thread state with the user message, and will update it again when a response is generated.

If you want the response message to be streamed, use the `streamResponse` option:

```tsx
await sendThreadMessage("What is the weather like today?", {
  streamResponse: true,
});
```

Tambo will automatically update the thread state as chunks are recieved. Find more information about using streaming [here.](streaming)

### Showing thread messages

Since tambo keeps the thread state updated, all you need to do is show the thread's messages somewhere:

```tsx
const { thread } = useTamboThread()

...

thread.messages.map((message) => (
<div>
  <p>Sent by: {message.role}</p>
  <p>message text: {message.content[0]?.text}</p>
  <p>component: {message.renderedComponent}</p>
</div>
))
```

### Setting the current thread

By default, tambo will create a new thread for you and use that thread for the `thread` state value.

If you want to switch to another thread you can use the `switchCurrentThread` function:

```tsx

const { switchCurrentThread } = useTamboThread()

...

switchCurrentThread(threadId)
```

The `thread` state will be updated, and anywhere you are rendering the threads list of messages will now be showing the new thread's messages!
