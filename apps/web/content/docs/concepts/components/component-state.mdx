title: Component State
description: Pass component state to Tambo as context for following user messages.
---

Tambo can track the internal state of generated components using `useTamboComponentState`, providing valuable context for responding to subsequent user messages.

```tsx title="Simple email component"

export const EmailSender = () => {
  ...
  const [emailBody, setEmailBody] = useState("") // tracks the message being typed
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false) // tracks whether the 'send' button has been clicked
  ...
}
```

For tambo to understand these state values when users say things like "finish this email for me" or "did I send that email earlier?", simply replace `useState` with `useTamboComponentState`:

```tsx title="Email component with tambo state"
import { useTamboComponentState } from "@tambo-ai/react";

export const EmailSender = () => {
  ...
  const [emailBody, setEmailBody] = useTamboComponentState("");
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useTamboComponentState(false);
  ...
}
```

Now tambo will know the current values of `emailBody` and `isSent`.
