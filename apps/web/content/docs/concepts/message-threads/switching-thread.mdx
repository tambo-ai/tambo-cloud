### Setting the current thread

By default, tambo will create a new thread for you and use that thread for the `thread` state value.

If you want to switch to another thread you can use the `switchCurrentThread` function:

```tsx
const { switchCurrentThread } = useTamboThread()

...

switchCurrentThread(threadId)
```

The `thread` state will be updated, and anywhere you are rendering the threads list of messages will now be showing the new thread's messages!
