### Sending thread messages

We recommend using the `useTamboThreadInput` hook to send messages to the thread.

```tsx
import { useTamboThreadInput } from "@tambo-ai/react";

const { value, setValue, submit } = useTamboThreadInput();
```

The `value` is the value of the message that you want to send.

The `setValue` is the function that you can use to update the value of the message.

To send a user's message to tambo, you can use the `submit` function:

You can also pass in an optional `options` object to the `submit` function.

```tsx
setValue("What is the weather like today?");

await submit({
  streamResponse: true, // We recommend streaming the response to the user
});
```

import { Card, Cards } from "fumadocs-ui/components/card";

<Cards>
  <Card title="Streaming" href="/docs/concepts/streaming">
    Learn more about streaming.
  </Card>
</Cards>

You can use `isPending` and `error` to show a loading state or an error state:

```tsx
if (isPending) {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}
```

```tsx
if (error) {
  return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
}
```

You can also use the `sendThreadMessage` function to send messages to the thread:

```tsx
const { sendThreadMessage } = useTamboThread();

await sendThreadMessage("What is the weather like today?", {
  streamResponse: true,
});
```
