Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI applications to interact with external tools and services through a standardized interface. Tambo provides support for MCP, allowing your agents to connect to various MCP servers and utilize their capabilities without manually registering individual tools. This is a great alternative to manually registering tools in Tambo, as all of an MCP server's tools become automatically available to your AI assistant.
