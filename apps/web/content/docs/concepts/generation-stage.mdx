title: Generation Stage
---

You may want to show your users something unique during each stage of tambo's response generation process, rather than a static 'loading' message for the entire duration.

To enable this, each thread has a `generationStage` property that can be used to track the progress of the response generation process.

You can expose the generation stage ( or a value you derive from it ) to your users so they know what their AI assistant is doing.

```typescript
const { generationStage } = useTamboThread();

...

if (generationStage === GenerationStage.CHOOSING_COMPONENT) {
  return <div>Tambo is choosing the best component to use...</div>;
}

if (generationStage === GenerationStage.FETCHING_CONTEXT) {
  return <div>Tambo is fetching additional data to hydrate the component...</div>;
}
...

```

### Stages

A thread's generation stage is an enum with the following possible values:

```typescript
enum GenerationStage {
  IDLE = "IDLE", // The thread is idle ( initial stage )
  CHOOSING_COMPONENT = "CHOOSING_COMPONENT", // Tambo is choosing the best component to use based on the user's message
  FETCHING_CONTEXT = "FETCHING_CONTEXT", // Tambo is fetching additional data to hydrate a chosen component
  HYDRATING_COMPONENT = "HYDRATING_COMPONENT", // Tambo is hydrating the component
  STREAMING_RESPONSE = "STREAMING_RESPONSE", // Tambo is streaming the response
  COMPLETE = "COMPLETE", // Tambo has completed successfully
  ERROR = "ERROR", // Tambo has encountered an error
}
```

### Status Message

Instead of determining a custom message for each stage, you can use the `statusMessage` property, which is a context-aware string that describes the current stage of the generation process, as generated by Tambo.

For example, if the generation was triggered by a user message asking about the weather in Tokyo, during the `CHOOSING_COMPONENT` stage the `statusMessage` might be something like `"Looking for a component to help with your request about the weather in Tokyo"`.

Use this along with the `isProcessing` helper property which returns `true` if the `generationStage` is `CHOOSING_COMPONENT`, `FETCHING_CONTEXT`, `HYDRATING_COMPONENT`, or `STREAMING_RESPONSE`.

```typescript
const { statusMessage, isProcessing } = useTamboThread();

if (isProcessing) {
  return <div>{statusMessage}</div>;
}
```
