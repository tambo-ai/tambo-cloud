description: Secure user isolation and authentication in Tambo applications.
---

In a Tambo application, each user has their own threads and messages, isolated from other users' data through secure token-based authentication. Tambo uses OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange to securely identify users, where your app authenticates with an OAuth provider, receives a JWT token, and exchanges it with Tambo for a Tambo-specific token. This ensures that users can only access their own conversation history and data while maintaining security and privacy across your application.
