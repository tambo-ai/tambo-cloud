title: Memory
description: Improve interactions through memory.
---

tambo can build and maintain persistent memory about users through conversations and interactions, enabled with a single configuration flag.

## Quick Setup

Enable memory in your tambo configuration:

```typescript
const config: TamboInitConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  memory: {
    enabled: true, // That's it! tambo will now maintain memory
  },
};
```

## What Gets Remembered

When memory is enabled, tambo automatically:

- Tracks conversation patterns and user preferences
- Maintains context across multiple sessions
- Learns from user interactions and feedback
- Builds a semantic understanding of user needs
- Adapts responses based on historical context

## Privacy & Control

Memory features are:

- End-to-end encrypted
- Compliant with data protection regulations
- User-controllable (can be cleared or disabled)
- Scoped to specific users or contexts

## Will Include

- Memory visualization tools
- Explicit memory management APIs
- Custom memory retention policies
- Cross-session context sharing
- Memory export and portability
