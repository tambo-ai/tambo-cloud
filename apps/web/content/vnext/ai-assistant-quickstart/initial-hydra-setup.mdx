title: Initial Hydra Setup
description: Learn how to set up and configure Hydra AI for building a CRM chat assistant.
---

In this quickstart, we'll build an AI-powered CRM assistant that helps users manage customer notes and emails. We'll start by setting up the core Hydra configuration.

First, let's create a configuration file for Hydra. We'll break this down into several parts:

### 1. Import Dependencies

```tsx
// src/config/hydraConfig.ts
import {
  createHydraComponentRegistry,
  createHydraToolRegistry,
  type HydraConfig,
  type HydraPersonality,
} from "hydra-ai-react";
```

### 2. Define AI Personality

The personality configuration defines how our CRM assistant will interact with users.

```tsx
const personality: HydraPersonality = {
  role: `You are a helpful CRM assistant focused on helping users manage customer interactions. You specialize in helping users create notes, edit them, and convert them into follow-up emails.`,

  style: `You communicate professionally while helping users manage their customer relationships efficiently. You provide clear suggestions for notes and emails while maintaining a helpful, business-appropriate tone.`,

  rules: [
    "Always confirm the customer/lead context before taking actions",
    "Provide clear previews of generated content",
    "Maintain professional language in generated emails",
    "Ask for clarification when customer details are unclear",
  ],
};
```

### 3. Create Registries

Set up registries for your tools and components. We'll add specific implementations in later sections.

```tsx
// Create registries for tools and components
export const toolRegistry = createHydraToolRegistry({
  // Tool definitions will be added here
});

export const componentRegistry = createHydraComponentRegistry({
  // Component definitions will be added here
});
```

  <Card href="/vnext/overview/components" title="Components Overview">

  </Card>
</Cards>

### 4. Initialize Configuration

Create a function to initialize Hydra with all the necessary configuration.

```tsx
export const initializeHydra = (): HydraConfig => {
  if (!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HYDRA_API_KEY) {
    throw new Error("NEXT_PUBLIC_HYDRA_API_KEY is not set");
  }

  return {
    apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HYDRA_API_KEY,
    toolRegistry,
    componentRegistry,
    personality,
    // debug: true, // Optional: Enable for development
  };
};
```

<Callout>
  Make sure to set your `NEXT_PUBLIC_HYDRA_API_KEY` in your environment
  variables before initializing the application.
</Callout>

## Adding the Context Provider

Next, wrap your application with the `HydraProvider` to make Hydra's functionality available throughout your app.

### Setting up the Provider

```tsx
// src/App.tsx or pages/_app.tsx
import { HydraProvider } from "hydra-ai-react";
import { type ReactElement } from "react";
import { initializeHydra } from "./config/hydraConfig";
```

### Implementing the App Wrapper

```tsx
export const App = (): ReactElement => {
  const hydraConfig = initializeHydra();

  return (
    <HydraProvider config={hydraConfig}>
      {/* Your app components */}
    </HydraProvider>
  );
};
```

<Callout>
  In the next section, we'll use the context hooks to create a chat interface.
