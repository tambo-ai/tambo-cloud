title: Initial tambo Setup
description: Learn how to set up and configure tambo for building a CRM chat assistant.
---

In this quickstart, we'll build an AI-powered CRM assistant that helps users manage customer notes and emails. We'll start by setting up the core tambo configuration.

## 1. Adding the Context Provider

<Callout>
  Make sure to set your `NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY` in your environment
  variables before initializing the application.
</Callout>

Next, wrap your application with the `TamboProvider` to make tambo's functionality available throughout your app.

**What's happening here:**

- Wrap your application with the `TamboProvider` to make tambo's functionality available throughout your app.

### Implementing the App Wrapper

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import { TamboProvider } from "tambo-react";
import { initializeTambo } from "./config/tamboConfig";

export const App = (): ReactElement => {
  const tamboConfig = initializeTambo();

  return (
    <TamboProvider config={tamboConfig}>
      {/* Your app components */}
    </TamboProvider>
  );
};
```

### 2. Configure tambo

**Definitions:**

- **tambo Config:** The configuration for the tambo SDK
- **Personality:** The personality of the AI assistant
- **Tool Registry:** A registry of tools (sometimes called function calls) that the AI can use to interact with the world
- **Component Registry:** A registry of UI components that the AI can use to interact with the user

The personality configuration defines how our CRM assistant will interact with users.

**What's happening here:**

- Define personality configuration
- Define tool registry
- Define component registry
- Initialize tambo with all the necessary configuration

<Callout>We will add tools, and components latter in this quickstart.</Callout>

```tsx title="src/config/tamboConfig.ts"
import {
  createTamboComponentRegistry,
  createTamboToolRegistry,
} from "tambo-react";

const personality = {
  role: `You are a helpful CRM assistant focused on helping users manage customer interactions. You specialize in helping users create notes, edit them, and convert them into follow-up emails.`,

  style: `You communicate professionally while helping users manage their customer relationships efficiently. You provide clear suggestions for notes and emails while maintaining a helpful, business-appropriate tone.`,

  rules: [
    "Always confirm the customer/lead context before taking actions",
    "Provide clear previews of generated content",
    "Maintain professional language in generated emails",
    "Ask for clarification when customer details are unclear",
  ],
};

// Create registries for tools and components
export const toolRegistry = createTamboToolRegistry({
  // Tool definitions will be added here
});

export const componentRegistry = createTamboComponentRegistry({
  // Component definitions will be added here
});

export const initializeTambo = (): TamboConfig => {
  if (!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY) {
    throw new Error("NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY is not set");
  }

  return {
    apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY,
    toolRegistry,
    componentRegistry,
    personality,
    // debug: true, // Optional: Enable for development
  };
};
```

## What you have now?

- Defined the function and personality of your AI assistant
- Created empty registries for tools and components
- Initialized tambo with the necessary configuration
- You know have access to the powerful context hooks to create a chat interface
