Let's explore advanced UI features that make your AI interface more dynamic and user-friendly.

In this section, we'll add suggestions, status updates, and streaming to our AI assistant.

[**Suggestions**](#1-adding-suggestions) help users discover what your AI can do:

- Suggestions are rendered after a message and its component has been generated
- They are based on the current conversation context
- They leverage the tools and components your AI has access to

[**Status updates**](#2-status-updates) help users understand what your AI is doing:

- Status updates are rendered after a message has been received
- They give the user a visual indication of the AI's progress
- Explain the AI is thinking, using tools, or generating a response

[**Streaming**](#3-streaming-responses) help reduce latency by sending the response in chunks:

- Streaming starts showing the user every response as it comes in
- It's great for long responses or when you want to show the user the AI is still thinking
- It's also great for reducing the load on the server

## 1. Adding Suggestions

**What's happening here:**

- Get suggestions using the `useTamboThread` hook
- Display them as clickable buttons with detailed descriptions
- Accept or dismiss suggestions
- Suggestions update based on context

```tsx title="Adding Suggestions to Message Thread"
import { useTamboThread } from "tambo-react";

export const MessageThread = () => {
  const { messages, operations } = useTamboThread("my-thread");
  const { suggestions } = useTamboThread("my-thread"); // [!code highlight]
  const { items, accept, dismiss } = suggestions; // [!code highlight]

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Messages */}
      <div>{/* ... existing message rendering ... */}</div>

      {/* Render AI Suggestions */}
      {items.length > 0 && (
        <div>
          {items.map((suggestion) => (
            <div key={suggestion.title}>
              <button
                onClick={() => accept(suggestion)}
                title={suggestion.detailedSuggestion}
              >
                {suggestion.title}
              </button>
              <button
                onClick={() => dismiss(suggestion)}
                aria-label={`Dismiss ${suggestion.title} suggestion`}
              >
                âœ•
              </button>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      )}

      {/* Input form */}
      <form>{/* ... existing form ... */}</form>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 2. Status Updates

Show users what the AI is doing with status updates:

- Status updates are generated as soon as the message is received
- They include the 'thinking' the AI is doing to find the right tools or components
- There are 5 possible statuses: `evaluating`, `tools`, `generating`, `complete`, and `error`

**What's happening here:**

- Get the status from the `useTamboThread` hook
- Render different icons and messages based on the status state
- Show loading indicators when appropriate

```tsx title="Rendering Status Updates"
import { useTamboThread } from "tambo-react";

export const MessageThread = () => {
  const { messages } = useTamboThread("my-thread");

  const renderStatus = (status) => {
    // Status icons for each state
    const icons = {
      evaluating: "ðŸ¤”",
      tools: "ðŸ”§",
      generating: "âœ¨",
    };

    return (
      <div role="status">
        {icons[status.state]} {status.message}
      </div>
    );
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map((message: TamboThreadMessage) => (
        <div key={message.content}>
          <div>{message.content}</div>
          {/* Render AI Status Updates */}
          {message.status?.map((status, index) => (
            <div key={index}>{renderStatus(status)}</div>
          ))}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 3. Streaming Responses

Latency is a big issue when it comes to AI. Streaming responses help reduce the latency by sending the response in chunks.

**What's happening here:**

- Enable streaming with `stream: true` option
- Messages automatically update as they arrive

```tsx title="Enabling Streaming Responses"
import { useTamboThread } from "tambo-react";

export const MessageThread = () => {
  {
    /* Same as before */
  }

  const handleSend = async (input: string) => {
    await operations.messages.generate(input, {
      stream: true, // [!code focus]
    });
  };

  {
    /* Same as before */
  }
};
```

Setting up streaming is that easy! Now if you want to more advanced control of streaming, you can use the `useMessageStreaming` & `useComponentStreaming` hooks.

Which gives you:

- `isStreaming`: Boolean flag indicating if a message is currently streaming
- `abort`: Function to stop the current streaming message
- `validation`: Validation state tracking including:
  - `completedPaths`: Paths that are fully received and validated
  - `validPaths`: Paths that are safe to use (even if incomplete)
  - `errors`: Any validation errors by path
  - `isComplete`: Whether the entire data structure is complete

This is useful when you need:

- Show partial updates in real-time
- Allow users to cancel generation
- Track completion status of different parts of the response
- Handle validation states for complex streaming data
