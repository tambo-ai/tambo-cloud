## Why would we want to make our note components interactive?

- Show interactive components in the message thread
- Share that state with the AI backend to make followup messages more accurate

Previous sections:

- [Adding Components](/vnext/ai-assistant-quickstart/adding-components)

We'll use the same note components from the previous section, but make them interactive.

## Creating Interactive Components

### 1. Update the Note Component to Use Hydra State

Use `useHydraState` is a hook provided by Hydra to manage the state of the component. It works just like React's `useState` hook, but it's synced with the AI backend.

**What's happening here:**

- Use the `useHydraState` hook to manage the state of the component
- State is automatically synced with the AI backend through Hydra's context

```tsx title="src/components/InteractiveNote.tsx"
import { useHydraState } from "hydra-ai-react";
import type { CustomerNoteProps } from "../schemas/crm-components"; // [!code highlight]

export const InteractiveNote: React.FC<Readonly<CustomerNoteProps>> = ({
  title,
  content: initialContent,
  associatedLeadId,
}) => {
  const { value, setValue } = useHydraState({
    content: initialContent,
    isSaved: false,
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <span>Lead ID: {associatedLeadId}</span>
        <h3>{title}</h3>
        <button
          onClick={() => setValue({ ...value, isEditing: !value.isEditing })}
        >
          {value.isSaved ? "Edit" : "Save"}
        </button>
      </div>
      {value.isEditing ? (
        <div>
          <textarea
            value={value.content}
            onChange={(e) => setValue({ ...value, content: e.target.value })}
          />
          <button onClick={() => setValue({ ...value, isSaved: true })}>
            Save
          </button>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <div>{value.content}</div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

  We should also make the email component interactive, but we'll save that for
  you to try out on your own.

## What you have now?

- Interactive Note component that can be used in the chat interface
- Now all your message threads will maintain any state changes made by the user!
- State is synced with the AI backend for followup messages
