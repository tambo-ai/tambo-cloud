title: Streaming
---

Use streaming to show response messages and components from Hydra in real-time, as they are being generated, to create more responsive and engaging user experiences.

```tsx
const { sendThreadMessage } = useHydra();
await sendThreadMessage(inputValue, { streamResponse: true });
```

Hydra will handle updating the thread's final message as data streams in, rather than waiting for the entire response to complete.

Render your thread messages like normal:

```tsx
const { thread } = useHydra();

...

<div>
  {thread.messages.map((message, index) => (
    <div
      key={index}
    >
      <div>{message.message}</div>
      <div>{message.renderedComponent}</div>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>;
```

## Preparing Components for Streaming

When streaming is enabled, Hydra will stream the response message and components to the client as they are being generated.

To prepare a component for streaming, you can use the `useHydraMessageContext` hook to get the current message and component:
