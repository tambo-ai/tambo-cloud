Hydra AI automatically analyzes user interactions and generates contextual suggestions. As users interact with your application, Hydra:

### When Suggestions Appear

Hydra generates suggestions appear after a component has been rendered.

### Types of Suggestions

- "Analyze this data in a chart"
- "Export results to PDF"
- "Filter these results"

## How Suggestions Work

When Hydra generates a suggestion, it provides:

```tsx title="AI-Generated Suggestion Structure"
interface HydraSuggestion {
  title: string; // A short title for the suggested action
  detailedSuggestion: string; // Detailed action to send to hydra
}
```

## Displaying Suggestions

Hydra automatically adds suggestions to your message thread. Here's how to display them:

```tsx title="Displaying AI Suggestions"
function ThreadWithSuggestions() {
  const {
    suggestions: { items, accept },
  } = useHydraThread(threadId);

  if (!items.length) return null;

  return (
    <div>
      {items.map((suggestion) => (
        <button
          key={suggestion.title}
          onClick={() => accept(suggestion)}
          title={suggestion.detailedSuggestion} // Show full description on hover
        >
          {suggestion.title}
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Message Integration

We recommend showing suggestions as a button in the message thread, after the component has been rendered.

```tsx title="Messages with AI Suggestions"
function MessageThread() {
  const { messages } = useHydraThread(threadId);
  const {
    suggestions: { accept },
  } = useHydraThread(threadId);

  return messages.map((message) => (
    <div key={message.id}>
      <div>{message.content}</div>

      {/* Display suggestions as options */}
      {message.suggestions?.length > 0 && (
        <SuggestionOptions items={message.suggestions} onAccept={accept} />
      )}
    </div>
  ));
}
```
