[Tambo](https://tambo.co) helps developers build LLM-based AI web apps by discovering, understanding, and packaging up emerging UX patterns so you can integrate them without building from scratch.

[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) has become the standard for how AI apps connect to external services and tools to extend their abilities. While MCP defines the technical protocol, it's up to developers to figure out how to present these capabilities to users in their app's UI.

At Tambo, we're building comprehensive MCP support so your app becomes "MCP-enabled" automatically. Today we're announcing support for [MCP Sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts#sampling), following our previous release of [MCP tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts#tools) support.

## What is MCP Sampling?

[MCP Sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts#sampling) is the ability of a connected MCP server to use the client’s LLM to do some processing. For example, a Weather MCP server might have a tool to get a summary of today's weather called `summarize_weather` which, when called by the MCP client (an app using Tambo), fetches weather data and then needs to use an LLM to summarize the data it has fetched before returning the summary to the client and end app user.

Without MCP sampling, this tool would need to know how to send requests to its own LLM, and that request would not know about the user or the previous messages in the conversation. With MCP sampling the server requests to use the LLM of the client to do this processing, and, through Tambo, gains all the additional context about the app, user, and thread that any other message gets.

## The UX of Sampling in Tambo

In our `Message` component, we show toolcall UI as an expandable dropdown that describes to the user the work that the LLM is performing while taking action or generating an appropriate response. Since an MCP sampling request is a way for an MCP server to use the LLM to do processing when determining its tool output, we consider a sampling request as a sort of “sub conversation” that is happening between the MCP tool and the LLM, so we represent it as an expandable list of messages within a toolcall’s UI.

The title of the dropdown defaults to “finished additional work” but is customizable. This default is based on the opinion that the end app user might be confused by any specific terminology about MCP or Sampling. At the end of the day, the end user just needs to know that the AI is “doing something”. To customize this, update the prop passed into the component within `message.tsx`.

## How to customize Tambo's Sampling UI

Behind the scenes, messages sent and returned through sampling requests are added to the user’s conversation thread in Tambo with the same structure as other messages, except that they have a `parentMessageId` field pointing to the assistant message that triggered the toolcall resulting in the sampling request. This way we can clearly see them as “sub messages” of a normal conversation message.

To build your own custom sampling UI, use Tambo’s [React SDK](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo) to get the list of messages for the current thread, and use the `parentMessageId` field on the messages to group and show sampling messages in any way you prefer.

## How to enable MCP Sampling in your app using Tambo

If you already have an app with Tambo running, you’ll need to:

- Upgrade your `tambo-ai/react` dependency to at least version `0.57.0` using `npm install @tambo-ai/react@0.57.0`
- Upgrade your installed Tambo `Message` component using `npx tambo@latest upgrade message`

If you haven’t integrated Tambo into your web app yet, new installations will automatically contain MCP Sampling functionality and UI. To get started, check out our [documentation](https://docs.tambo.co/getting-started/quickstart).

## Up next for MCP Sampling support

- Allow clientside sampling support for apps where the user is allowed to add their own mcp servers.
- Enable user confirmation or rejection of sampling requests.
- Show unique sampling requests separately within one toolcall.
