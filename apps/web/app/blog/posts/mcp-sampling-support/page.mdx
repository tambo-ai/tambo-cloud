[Tambo](https://tambo.co) helps developers build LLM-based AI web apps by discovering, understanding, and packaging up emerging UX patterns so you can integrate them without building from scratch.

[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) has become the standard for how AI apps connect to external services and tools to extend their abilities. While MCP defines the technical protocol, it's up to developers to figure out how to present these capabilities to users in their app's UI.

At Tambo, we're building comprehensive MCP support so your app becomes "MCP-enabled" automatically. Today we're announcing support for [MCP Sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts#sampling), following our previous release of [MCP tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts#tools) support.

## What is MCP Sampling?

[MCP Sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts#sampling) is the ability of an MCP server to use the client’s LLM. For example, when a user asks "What's the weather like today?", a Weather MCP server will fetch the raw temperature and forecast data. With sampling, it can then use _the app's LLM_ to summarize the data before showing it to the user.

Without MCP sampling, the server would need its own AI setup and wouldn't have access to your conversation history or user context.

With MCP Sampling through Tambo, the server uses Tambo's AI setup and gains full context about the conversation, user, and app state.

## The UX of Sampling in Tambo

In a Tambo app using our pre-built `Message` component, when Tambo decides to use a tool we display an expandable dropdown that shows details of the tool call to the user. We consider a sampling request as a sort of “sub-conversation” that is happening between the MCP tool and Tambo, so we represent it as an expandable list of messages within a tool's information UI.

In the following example we use an `emojify_via_llm` MCP tool which uses Sampling to turn a string into emojis. Within the dropdown you can see the messages the tool sent to Tambo and the responses it received.

The title of the dropdown defaults to “finished additional work” but is customizable. This default is based on the opinion that the end app user might be confused by any specific terminology about MCP or Sampling. At the end of the day, the end user just needs to know that the AI is “doing something”. To customize this, update the `titleText` prop passed into the `SamplingSubThread` component within `message.tsx`.

## How to customize Tambo's Sampling UI

Behind the scenes, messages sent and returned through sampling requests are added to the user’s conversation thread. The sampling messages have a `parentMessageId` field pointing to the assistant message tool call that triggered the sampling request. This is what distinguishes them as “sub messages” of a normal conversation message.

To build your own custom sampling UI, use Tambo’s [React SDK](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo) to get the list of messages for the current thread, and use the `parentMessageId` field on the messages to group and show sampling messages in any way you prefer.

## How to enable MCP Sampling in your app using Tambo

If you already have an app with Tambo running, you’ll need to:

- Upgrade your `tambo-ai/react` dependency to at least version `0.57.0` using `npm install @tambo-ai/react@0.57.0`
- Upgrade your installed Tambo `Message` component using `npx tambo@latest upgrade message`

If you haven’t integrated Tambo into your web app yet, new installations will automatically contain MCP Sampling functionality and UI. To get started, check out our [documentation](https://docs.tambo.co/getting-started/quickstart).

## Up next for MCP Sampling support

- Allow client-side MCP servers to make sampling requests.
- Enable user confirmation or rejection of sampling requests.
