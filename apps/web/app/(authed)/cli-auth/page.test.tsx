/**
 * This is a unit test file for the CLI Auth page.
 *
 * NOTE: This file is intended to demonstrate the testing approach for this component,
 * but the actual tests would need proper test infrastructure setup in the web app.
 *
 * To run these tests, you would need to:
 * 1. Install @testing-library/react and its dependencies
 * 2. Configure Jest with the proper DOM testing environment
 *
 * These tests verify:
 * - The page starts at the project selection step (not the auth step)
 * - Projects are loaded when the page renders
 * - UI components reflect the authenticated state
