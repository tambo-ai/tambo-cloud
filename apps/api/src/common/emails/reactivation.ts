Hey ${displayName},

Michael here, co-founder of tambo. I noticed you signed up ${variables.daysSinceSignup} ${dayText} ago${variables.hasProject ? " and created a project" : ""}, but haven't ${variables.hasProject ? "been active recently" : "set up your first project yet"}.

I wanted to personally reach out and see if there's anything I can help with? 

Sometimes getting started can feel overwhelming, so I'd be happy to:
â€¢ Walk you through the setup process
â€¢ Help you understand which features would work best for your use case
â€¢ Answer any questions you might have
â€¢ Jump on a quick 15-minute onboarding call

Just reply to this email or <a href="https://cal.com/michaelmagan" style="color: #0066cc; text-decoration: underline;">book a time that works for you</a>.

No pressure at all - I know how busy things get. But if you're still interested in using tambo, I'm here to make sure you have a great experience.

Best,
Michael
Co-Founder, tambo

P.S. If you're no longer interested, no worries at all! Just let me know and I'll make sure we don't send any more emails.
