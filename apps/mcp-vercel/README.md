### MCP Vercel deployable placeholder

This directory documents the deployable based on the Inkeep template (`inkeep/mcp-for-vercel`). The actual code is maintained in a fork of that template and deployed as its own Vercel project attached to `mcp.tambo.co`.

See `devdocs/mcp-vercel.md` for environment variables, domain, and observability setup.
