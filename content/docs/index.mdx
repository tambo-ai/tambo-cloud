## Introduction

Hydra AI is an AI-powered router that helps you build adaptive UIs by surfacing the right features to users based on context. It analyzes user behavior and application state to intelligently route users to the most relevant features and content.

## Key Features

- **Contextual Routing**: Automatically direct users to relevant features based on their behavior and needs
- **Adaptive UI**: Surface different UI components and features depending on user context
- **Simple Integration**: Easy to integrate with existing React applications
- **Type-Safe**: Built with TypeScript for reliable development
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any modern JavaScript framework

## Why Hydra AI?

Traditional routing systems are static and don't adapt to user needs. Hydra AI brings intelligence to your application's navigation by:

- Learning from user behavior patterns
- Adapting to different user contexts
- Optimizing feature discovery
- Reducing navigation friction
