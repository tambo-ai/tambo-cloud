## Introduction

Hydra AI is an AI-powered router that helps you build adaptive UIs by intelligently routing users to relevant features based on context and behavior.

## Getting Started

There are two ways to add Hydra AI to your project:

1. **Using the CLI (Recommended)**  
   The fastest way to get started with automatic setup and component scanning.
   [Install with CLI →](/docs/getting-started/installation)

2. **Manual Setup**  
   For more control over the integration process.
   [Manual Setup Guide →](/docs/troubleshooting/manual-setup)

After installation, learn how to [add and register components →](/docs/getting-started/adding-components)

## Key Features

- **Contextual Routing**: Direct users to relevant features based on behavior
- **Adaptive UI**: Surface UI components based on context
- **Type-Safe**: Built with TypeScript
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any React based framework

## Why Hydra AI?

Unlike static routers, Hydra AI adapts to user needs by:

- Learning from behavior patterns
- Adapting to context
- Optimizing discovery
- Reducing friction
