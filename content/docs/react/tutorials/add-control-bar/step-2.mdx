title: "Step 2: Add the control bar and Hydra AI"
---

In this step we'll add the control bar component and install Hydra. This will include adding a Hydra config file to the app, and getting a Hydra API key set. The Hydra CLI will help us with that.

## Add the control bar component

Let's start by adding the control bar component to the app using the hydra cli. This will also initialize the Hydra config file for us.

We can use the following command:

```bash
npx hydra-ai-cli add control-bar
```

You'll be prompted to create a Hydra account, and then the control-bar component will be added to the app under `/src/components/ui/control-bar.tsx`. Note that instead of importing a package that contains the control bar, we've installed the source code of the control bar into the app so we can modify it to fit our needs.

If you look at the control bar code, you'll see that the component has some dependencies on Hydra, so we'll install that next.

## Add Hydra AI

Before we can have Hydra respond to messages and control UI components, we need to install and configure it.


1. **Install Hydra AI dependency**

    First, we'll install Hydra AI by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install hydra-ai
    ```

2. **Add Hydra Config file**

    Next, we'll create a Hydra config file, where we create an instance of Hydra and eventually register the components we want it to use.

    Add a new file called `hydra-config.ts` under `src/` with the following contents:

    ```ts
    import { HydraClient } from "hydra-ai";

    export function initializeHydra() {
        const hydra = new HydraClient({
            hydraApiKey: process.env.HYDRAAI_API_KEY,
        });

        return hydra;
    }
    ```

    You can see that this HydraClient is initialized with the API key from the environment variables. We'll set that up next.

3. **Set Hydra API key**

    Finally, we'll set the Hydra API key in the environment variables.

    You can get a Hydra API key by creating a new Hydra "project" in the Hydra dashboard [here](https://usehydra.ai/dashboard).

    Once you've created a project and copied an API key, add the following to the `.env.local` file:

    ```
    HYDRAAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```
