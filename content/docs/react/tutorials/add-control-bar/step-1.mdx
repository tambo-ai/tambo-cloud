import { ModalImage } from "@/components/modal-image";

In this step we'll get the starter app running locally.

## Get the starter app running locally

1. **Clone the repository**

    First, we'll get the starting code for the app by running the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone -b tutorial-start https://github.com/use-hydra-ai/hydra-controlbar-starter.git
    ```

    If you look around the code, you'll see that it's a simple CRM dashboard app with a few components for editing leads, notes, meetings, and messages.

    The dashboard is mostly made of form and list components that you can find under `/src/components`. The components are connected to an example, in-memory API that you can find under `/src/services`.

2. **Install dependencies**

    Next, we'll install the dependencies by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the app**

    Finally, we'll run the app by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Now you can open the app in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

In the next step, we'll add the control bar to the app.
