## What you'll learn

At the end of this tutorial, you'll have a real Slack AI app in a workspace that you can send messages to, and that can respond to user messages with interactive UI components.

You'll learn:

- How to use [Bolt](https://api.slack.com/bolt) to build a Slack app.
- How Hydra AI simplifies the process of building AI apps.
- How you can customize the UI components that Hydra can control, and how it controls them.
- How you can use Hydra to build your own Slack AI app for a different purpose.

In the next step, we'll get the starter app running locally, and install the test app into a Slack workspace.
