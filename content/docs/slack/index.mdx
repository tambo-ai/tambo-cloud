## Build AI Slack apps with Hydra

Hydra is the simplest way to build AI Slack apps. With Hydra, you can build intelligent Slack apps that allow users to interact conversationally with AI to accomplish tasks.

All you need to do is tell Hydra what UI components the user can interact with. Hydra handles the rest.

Hydra handles the complexity of:

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Process user messages and understand their intent
- **Dynamic UI Generation**: Automatically choose the appropriate Slack UI components based on context
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation context and state for more natural interactions
