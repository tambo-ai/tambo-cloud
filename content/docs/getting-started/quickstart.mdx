# Quick Start Guide for Hydra AI CLI

This guide will help you get started quickly with Hydra AI CLI to integrate dynamic, context-aware UI components into your project.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (v16+ recommended)
2. **NPM** or **Yarn**
3. **Hydra AI CLI** (installed globally or locally)

---

## Installation

If you haven't installed the Hydra AI CLI yet, run:

```bash
npm install -g hydra-ai-cli
```

---

## Step 1: Initialize Hydra AI in Your Project

Run the following command from the root of your project:

```bash
hydra init
```

### What Happens:

- Validates that `package.json` exists.
- Authenticates your account.
- Allows you to select or create a project.
- Generates and saves an API key in a `.env` file.
- Optionally installs the `hydra-ai` package.
- Scans for components in your `src` directory.
- Creates a `hydra-config.ts` file for component registration.

---

## Step 2: Configure Components

Open the newly created `hydra-config.ts` file in your project.

```typescript
import MyComponent from "./components/MyComponent";
import { HydraClient } from "hydra-ai";

export function registerComponents() {
  const hydra = new HydraClient({
    hydraApiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HYDRAAI_API_KEY,
  });

  hydra.registerComponent(
    "MyComponent",
    "Description of MyComponent",
    MyComponent,
    { prop1: "string", prop2: "number" } // Update props as needed
  );

  return hydra;
}
```

### Update Props and Descriptions:

- Adjust the `propsDefinition` as per your component's props.
- Add meaningful descriptions to improve clarity.

---

## Step 3: Use Components in Your App

Once your components are registered, you can start using Hydra AI in your app. For example, dynamically render components based on user context:

```typescript
import { registerComponents } from "./hydra-config";

const hydra = registerComponents();

hydra.render("MyComponent", { prop1: "value1", prop2: 42 });
```

---

## Step 4: Deploy and Test

1. Ensure your `.env` file contains the correct API key:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_HYDRAAI_API_KEY=your_generated_api_key
   ```

2. Deploy your app as usual (`npm run build`, etc.).

3. Test your dynamic components in various contexts.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Missing `package.json`**:

   ```
   This doesn't look like a valid Node.js project. Please run this command from the root of your project.
   ```

2. **Authentication Errors**:
   Ensure you are logged in and authenticated before initializing.

3. **Missing Dependencies**:
   If `hydra-ai` is not installed, run:
   ```bash
   npm install hydra-ai
   ```
