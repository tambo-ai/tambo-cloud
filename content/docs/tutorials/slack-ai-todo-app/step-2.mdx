title: "Step 2: Add Hydra AI"
---

In this step, we'll install Hydra, add a Hydra config file to the app, and get a Hydra API key set.

## Add Hydra AI

Before we can have Hydra respond to messages and control UI components, we need to install and configure it.


1. **Install Hydra AI dependency**

    First, we'll install Hydra AI by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install @hydra-ai/slack
    ```

2. **Add Hydra Config file**

    Next, we'll create a Hydra config file, where we create an instance of Hydra and eventually register the components we want it to use.

    Add a new file called `hydra-config.ts` under `src/` with the following contents:

    ```ts
    import { HydraClient } from "@hydra-ai/slack";

    export function initializeHydra() {
        const hydra = new HydraClient({
            hydraApiKey: process.env.HYDRAAI_API_KEY,
        });

        return hydra;
    }
    ```

    You can see that this HydraClient is initialized with the API key from the environment variables. We'll set that up next.

3. **Set Hydra API key**

    Finally, we'll set the Hydra API key in the environment variables.

    You can get a Hydra API key by creating a new Hydra "project" in the Hydra dashboard [here](https://usehydra.ai/dashboard).

    Once you've created a project and copied an API key, add the following to the `.env` file:

    ```
    HYDRAAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```

    Now your full `.env` file should look like this:

    ```
    SLACK_APP_TOKEN=<your-slack-app-token>
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<your-slack-bot-token>
    HYDRAAI_API_KEY=<your-hydraai-api-key>
    ```

In the next step, we'll add a message listener that uses Hydra to respond to user messages.
