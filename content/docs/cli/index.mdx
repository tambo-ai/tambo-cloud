# CLI Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers common issues you might encounter when using the Hydra AI CLI and how to resolve them.

## Common Issues

### Installation Problems

#### CLI Not Found

If you get a "command not found" error after installation:

```bash
hydra: command not found
```

Try these solutions:

1. Reinstall the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install --global hydra-ai-cli
```

2. Check if your PATH includes npm global binaries:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

3. Run the CLI using npx:

```bash
npx hydra-ai-cli
```

### Authentication Issues

#### Login and Signup

If you encounter issues during login or signup:

```bash
Error: Failed to log in
```

Solutions:

1. Ensure you have a stable internet connection
2. Try the signup command first if you're a new user:

```bash
hydra signup
# or
npx hydra-ai-cli signup
```

3. For existing users, use:

```bash
hydra login
# or
npx hydra-ai-cli login
```

### Project Management

#### Listing Projects

If you can't see your projects:

```bash
hydra listProjects
# or
npx hydra-ai-cli listProjects
```

The command will show a table with project IDs and names. If it fails:

1. Verify you're logged in
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try logging out and back in

#### Creating New Projects

To create a new project:

```bash
hydra createProject
# or
npx hydra-ai-cli createProject
```

You'll be prompted to enter a project name. If creation fails:

1. Ensure you have a valid login session
2. Try using a different project name
3. Check for network connectivity

#### Adding Provider Keys

To add an OpenAI API key to your project:

```bash
hydra addProvider --id <project_id>
# or
npx hydra-ai-cli addProvider --id <project_id>
```

You'll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API key securely.

## Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for more detailed error information:

```bash
hydra --debug <command>
# or
npx hydra-ai-cli --debug <command>
```

## Version Conflicts

If you experience version-related issues:

1. Check your CLI version:

````bash
hydra --version
# or
npx hydra-ai-cli --version
    ```

2. Update to the latest version:

```bash
npm update --global hydra-ai-cli
# or
npm update --global @hydra-ai/cli
````

## Network Problems

### Timeout Issues

For slow connections, increase the timeout:

```bash
hydra <command> --timeout 30000
# or
npx hydra-ai-cli <command> --timeout 30000
```

## Getting Help

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Run the help command:

```bash
hydra help
# or
npx hydra-ai-cli help
```

2. Check the verbose logs:

```bash
hydra <command> --verbose
# or
npx hydra-ai-cli <command> --verbose
```

3. Contact support:
