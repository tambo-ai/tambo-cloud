# Contributing to Tambo

Thanks for contributing. This guide covers workflow, review requirements, and documentation standards for the Tambo Cloud monorepo.

## Quick Links

- API changes live here in this repo: `tambo-cloud`
- React SDK: `https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo`
- Getting started with local dev: [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](./GETTING_STARTED.md)
- Release and SDK process: [`RELEASING.md`](./RELEASING.md)

## PR Titles and Versioning (Required)

We use Conventional Commits and semantic versioning for PR titles. This powers release automation.

Use the format:

```
<type>[scope]: <description>
```

Examples:

- `feat(api): add transcript export endpoint`
- `fix(web): prevent duplicate project creation`
- `chore(db): reorganize migration files`

Breaking changes must be clearly indicated:

- `feat!: require authentication for all API endpoints`
- Or add a BREAKING CHANGE footer.

Types commonly used: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`, `ci`, `test`.

## API and SDK Source of Truth

- API changes go in this monorepo under `apps/api`. Please link to relevant files or modules in your PR description.
- TypeScript SDK (`@tambo-ai/typescript-sdk`) is auto-generated by Stainless from the API's OpenAPI spec.
  - Do not manually change the TypeScript SDK repository or publish versions directly.
  - Ship the API change in `tambo-cloud`, deploy, and allow Stainless to generate an SDK release PR.
  - See [`RELEASING.md`](./RELEASING.md) for details and the Stainless workflow.

## Visual Changes Require a Short Video (Required if UI changes)

If your change affects UI or DX visually (new component, component update, dashboard change):

- Include a short video demo in the PR. A 30â€“90 second screen recording is ideal.
- Show before vs after when relevant.
- If applicable, include the route or usage snippet.

## Documentation (Required)

All functional changes must include documentation.

- Add or update pages in the docs site. If contributing to this repo's docs, use `apps/web/content/docs` (preferred) and include a `meta.json` per the meta rules.
- Follow our documentation style guidance (progressive examples, clear benefits, integration notes).
- Link related concepts and features. Keep examples accurate and minimal.

Helpful references:

- Meta organization rules: see `meta.json` conventions.
- Authoring style and structure: follow internal documentation rules.

## Component Library and Showcase (Required when updating components)

If you change or add components in the library:

- Update the public showcase site (`ui.tambo.co`) to include or reflect your changes.
- If the showcase CTA or content in the website needs updating, adjust `apps/web/components/sections/showcase.tsx` accordingly.
- Include a short video demo in your PR (see above).

## Lint, Types, and Tests (Required)

Before requesting review:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run check-types
npm test
```

- Fix all lint errors and warnings.
- Ensure TypeScript passes across the monorepo.
- Add tests where meaningful. Keep units pure and small.

## Code Style and Architecture

- Prefer functional code, minimal abstractions, and strict TypeScript types.
- Keep error handling explicit with early returns.
- Follow NestJS conventions in `apps/api` and Next.js conventions in `apps/web`.
- Database changes: one logical change per Drizzle migration, idempotent, with clear up/down.

## Branching and PR Process

- Small, focused PRs are easier to review and safer to merge.
- Include context: problem statement, approach, and tradeoffs.
- Link related issues or discussions.
- Add screenshots or videos for UI changes.

## AI Assistant Usage and Internal AI Docs (Follow Required)

When using AI tools to assist development:

- Follow our internal AI guidelines. Start with these references in the repo:
  - `.charlie/instructions/general.md`
  - `.charlie/instructions/react.md`
  - `.charlie/instructions/typescript.md`
  - `.charlie/instructions/architecture.md`
- Also align with our team usage guides for editors and models:
  - Cursor: `https://docs.cursor.com/`
  - Claude: `https://docs.anthropic.com/claude`

## Security and Secrets

- Never commit secrets. Use environment files and the documented variables.
- Rotate keys used for local testing if accidentally exposed.

## Commit Messages

- Use Conventional Commits with scopes (`api`, `web`, `core`, `db`, etc.).
- Present tense, imperative mood, short and descriptive.
- Reference issues when relevant, for example: `fix(api): prevent duplicate signup (#123)`.

## Reviewer Checklist (Copy in PR if helpful)

- [ ] Title follows Conventional Commits and indicates SemVer impact
- [ ] Linked API changes (if applicable) and no manual SDK edits
- [ ] Short video included for visual changes
- [ ] Docs updated and linked
- [ ] Showcase updated (if component changes)
- [ ] Lint, types, and tests are green

Thanks for helping make Tambo better.
