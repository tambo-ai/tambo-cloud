# Langfuse Integration with Vercel AI SDK - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated Langfuse with Vercel AI SDK in your monorepo backend package. The integration uses the official `experimental_telemetry` parameter approach as documented in the Langfuse documentation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Package Dependencies

- Added `langfuse: "^3.38.4"` to the backend package dependencies
- Added `@types/node` for TypeScript support
- All dependencies are properly installed and configured

### 2. Configuration Setup

Created `packages/backend/src/config/langfuse.config.ts` with:

- `createLangfuseConfig()` function that reads environment variables
- `createLangfuseTelemetryConfig()` function that creates telemetry configuration
- Automatic detection of Langfuse credentials to enable/disable integration

### 3. Integration in AISdkClient

Modified `packages/backend/src/services/llm/ai-sdk-client.ts`:

- Added import for Langfuse telemetry configuration
- Integrated `experimental_telemetry` parameter in both `generateText` and `streamText` calls
- Added metadata including chainId, provider, and model information
- Automatic activation when Langfuse credentials are provided

### 4. Exports

Updated `packages/backend/src/index.ts` to export:

- `createLangfuseConfig`
- `createLangfuseTelemetryConfig`

## Environment Variables Required

To enable Langfuse integration, set these environment variables:

```bash
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com  # Optional, defaults to cloud.langfuse.com
```

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Detection**: The integration automatically detects if Langfuse credentials are provided
2. **Conditional Activation**: Only enables telemetry when both `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` are set
3. **Metadata Tracking**: Includes useful metadata in traces:
   - Chain ID
   - Provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)
   - Model name
   - Function ID for identification

## Integration Points

The integration works at the `AISdkClient` level, which means:

- All AI SDK calls (both streaming and non-streaming) are automatically traced
- Works with all supported providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Groq)
- Includes tool usage tracking
- Maintains compatibility with existing code

## Usage

No code changes needed in your application code. The integration is transparent:

```typescript
// This will automatically include Langfuse telemetry if configured
const client = new AISdkClient(apiKey, model, provider, chainId);
const result = await client.complete({
  /* your params */
});
```

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Set the required environment variables
2. Run your application
3. Make AI SDK calls through the backend
4. Check your Langfuse dashboard for traces

## Status

✅ **Implementation Complete**: The integration is fully implemented and ready for use
✅ **Linting Passed**: All code passes linting checks
✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support included
✅ **Environment Handling**: Graceful handling of missing credentials

The integration follows the official Langfuse documentation and uses the recommended `experimental_telemetry` approach for Vercel AI SDK integration.
