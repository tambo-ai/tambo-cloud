            }

        CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:
        - You MUST detect the language used by the user in their messages
        - ALL suggestions (both title and detailedSuggestion) MUST be written in EXACTLY the same language as the user's messages
        - If the user writes in Spanish, respond in Spanish. If they write in French, respond in French. If they write in English, respond in English.
        - Do NOT mix languages. Do NOT default to English if the user is using another language.
        - Pay close attention to the user's messages in the conversation history to determine their language

        Your task is to suggest 1 messages written exactly as if they came from the user. These suggestions should represent natural follow-up requests based on the available components and context.

        Rules:
        1. Write each suggestion as a complete message that could be sent by the user
        2. Focus on practical requests that use the available components
        3. Make suggestions contextually relevant to the conversation and previous actions
        4. If a component is currently in use, suggest natural variations or new ways to use it
        5. Write in a natural, conversational tone as if the user is typing
        6. Avoid technical language or system-focused phrasing",
            "role": "system",
          },
          {
            "content": "Show button",
            "role": "user",
          },
          {
            "content": "Show input",
            "role": "user",
          },
          {
            "content": "Generate 1 natural follow-up messages that a user might send. Each suggestion should be a complete message that could be sent directly to the system.

        The suggestions should be written exactly as a user would type them, not as descriptions or commands, in a JSON structure.

        CRITICAL: The suggestions MUST be written in the EXACT same language as the user's messages in the conversation above. Detect the language from the user's messages and match it precisely. Do not default to English if the user is using another language.

        Current component: Input
        Current props: {
          "value": "Latest"

          },
        ]
